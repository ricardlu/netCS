We provide :

1) The data processed with CDO for the reference datasets HadISST and COBEv2 (.nc)

2) The regions reference and strength list are the outputs of delta-maps algorithm applied to processed_HadISST_sst_2x2_197501-201412.nc
Regions reference contains the SST regions in binary maps  (.npy)
Strength list contains the values of the strengths of SST regions   (.npy)
Average Causal Effect values in the nine climate-relevant regions of HadISST (.npy)


3) The values of ECS and TCR of the 27 CMIP6 models extracted from litterature (.txt)

4) A list containing the list of member ids of CMIP6 models

5) Out of the 17 CMIP6 models, we provide two examples of Data-CMIP6-model/ containing pre-processed SST historical outputs(.nc)
